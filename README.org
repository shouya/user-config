** Dependencies

- git-crypt (not for bootstraping)


** Profiles

Run =make <profile>= to provision the config files for that profile.

- base :: base system, applies to any unix for any purpose
- linux-gui :: linux-specific gui related config (wayland, x, other tools)
- emacs :: emacs config
- shell :: zsh config
- tools :: config for non-os specific tools
- systemd :: systemd-user config


*** =base= profile

Base is the only profile that can be provisioned without needing a working gpg. Run

#+begin_src
make -DNO_GIT_CRYPT base
#+end_src

to provision it. After it, set up GPG encryption keys, and run:

#+begin_src
git crypt unlock
make base
#+end_src
